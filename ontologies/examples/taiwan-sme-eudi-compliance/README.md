# Taiwan SME EUDI Compliance Use Case

This use case demonstrates how the agent-ontology can be used to model a compliance agent for a non-EU small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) that needs to interact with the EU market using the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet framework.

The example shows an agent acting on behalf of a Taiwanese SME. The agent manages multiple digital identities:
-   **EUDI Wallet Identity**: For interacting with EU-based systems.
-   **Taiwan Corporate Identity (TW-DIW)**: The company's native digital identity.
-   **Stablecoin Settlement Identity**: For handling cross-border payments using stablecoins.

The agent has capabilities to perform KYC/AML submissions, retrieve credentials from EU authorities, submit corporate filings, and execute stablecoin payments, all while operating under a clear delegation of authority from the parent company. This illustrates a practical application of the ontology for complex, cross-border business operations.
