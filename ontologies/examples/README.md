# Agent Ontology Examples

This directory contains a collection of practical examples demonstrating the application of the Semantic Agent Communication Community Group's (SAC-CG) Agent Ontology. These examples are designed to illustrate how the core semantic concepts—such as Agent Identity, Capabilities, Intent, Delegation, Actions, Artifacts, and Accountability—can be used to model real-world multi-agent workflows and complex business scenarios.

Each subdirectory within `examples/` represents a distinct use case and typically includes:

*   **`README.md`**: A detailed explanation of the use case, including the user story, key concepts illustrated, workflow breakdown, and ontology mapping.
*   **`.ttl` files**: Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) files representing instances of the ontology, defining agents, intents, delegations, and other semantic entities.
*   **`.jsonld` files**: JSON-LD (JSON for Linking Data) representations of the ontology instances, often used for data exchange and integration with JSON-based systems.
*   **`.shacl.ttl` files**: SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) files that define validation rules for the corresponding `.ttl` and `.jsonld` instances, ensuring data consistency and adherence to the ontology's constraints.
