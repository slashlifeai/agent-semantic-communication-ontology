# Semantic Agent Communication Community Group
*W3C Community Group — Draft Repository Overview*

## 1. Scope and Purpose

The **Semantic Agent Communication Community Group (SAC‑CG)** aims to define a shared, interoperable semantic model for communication between AI Agents across heterogeneous systems, vendors, and jurisdictions.

This includes foundational ontology layers for **identity binding**, **capability description**, **delegation structures**, **intent semantics**, and **verifiable execution records** supporting secure, auditable agent‑to‑agent interaction.

The ontology defined here is abstracted from real operational cross‑border systems to ensure practical applicability. It aligns with the broader Web architecture and provides a future pathway toward **ISO/IEC**–level interoperability.

### 1.1 Foundational Concepts

- **Agent‑Native Computation Model**  
  Autonomous agents function as first‑class OS entities, not merely applications.

- **Semantic‑Operational Ontology**  
  Ontology concepts map directly to executable system behaviors.

- **Ledger‑Based Accountability**  
  Immutable, append‑only records ensure verifiable auditability and cross‑system trust.

- **TEE/DID/Audit Chain Binding**  
  Cryptographic identity and execution guarantees tied to secure hardware anchors.

- **Economic and Payment Primitives**  
  A model for defining and executing value transfers (payments) between agents in a standardized, auditable manner.

### 1.2 Relationship to the Web and Semantic Web

This project extends Web principles into autonomous agent interaction:

- **Global Interoperability** via URIs, RDF, JSON‑LD  
- **Semantic Clarity** via OWL/RDF definitions  
- **Linked Data + Reasoning** enabling inference over identity, delegation, and execution chains

## 2. Repository Structure

### **2.1 `ontologies/` — Core Semantic Definitions**
- `.ttl` ontology definitions  
- `context/`: JSON‑LD contexts  
- `profiles/`: JSON schema validation profiles  
- `examples/`: Usage samples  

### **2.2 `specs/` — Human‑Readable Specifications**
- Design rationale, conceptual explanations, and narrative specifications  

### **2.3 `discussions/` — Community Collaboration**
- Meeting notes, proposals, community RFCs  

### **2.4 `tests/` — Conformance and Consistency**
- SHACL or equivalent constraint validation suites  

---

## 3. Reference Implementation

The ontology is validated against **SlashLife 的「[AI Workforce OS](https://slashlife.ai/technology/workforceos/)」與「AI Backoffice」**, an agent‑native runtime supporting cross‑border operational use cases.

The CG encourages independent implementations.  
The ontology itself is vendor‑neutral and not bound to any runtime.

## 4. Goals of the Community Group

The CG aims to develop:

- A unified semantic model for agent **identity**, **capabilities**, **delegation**, and **intent**  
- Machine‑interpretable structures enabling **verifiable execution**, **traceability**, and **auditability**  
- Interoperability across multi‑vendor, multi‑jurisdiction, and cross‑layer environments  
- A pathway toward future **W3C Notes** and downstream **ISO/IEC** standardization

## 5. Getting Started

### 5.1 Quick Start

This example shows how to validate an agent definition against its schema and expand its semantic meaning using Python.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install jsonschema pyld
```

**Example Code:**
```python
import json
from jsonschema import validate
from pyld import jsonld

# 1. Load the agent definition and its schema
with open('ontologies/examples/minimal-agent.jsonld', 'r') as f:
    agent_doc = json.load(f)

with open('ontologies/profiles/agent.jsonld', 'r') as f:
    agent_schema = json.load(f)

# 2. Validate the document against the schema
try:
    validate(instance=agent_doc, schema=agent_schema)
    print("✅ Validation successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Validation failed: {e}")

# 3. Expand the document to see its full semantic meaning
# (Note: for a real application, you would use a remote context)
with open('ontologies/context/agent.jsonld', 'r') as f:
    context_doc = json.load(f)

expanded = jsonld.expand(agent_doc, {'@context': context_doc})
print("\nExpanded JSON-LD:")
print(json.dumps(expanded, indent=2))
```
