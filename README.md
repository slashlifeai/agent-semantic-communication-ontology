# Semantic Agent Communication Community Group
*W3C Community Group — Draft Repository Overview*

## 1. Scope and Purpose

The **Semantic Agent Communication Community Group (SAC‑CG)** aims to define a shared, interoperable semantic model for communication between AI Agents across heterogeneous systems, vendors, and jurisdictions.

This includes foundational ontology layers for **identity binding**, **capability description**, **delegation structures**, **intent semantics**, and **verifiable execution records** supporting secure, auditable agent‑to‑agent interaction.

The ontology defined here is abstracted from real operational cross‑border systems to ensure practical applicability. It aligns with the broader Web architecture and provides a future pathway toward **ISO/IEC**–level interoperability.

### 1.1 Foundational Concepts

- **Agent‑Native Computation Model**  
  Autonomous agents function as first‑class OS entities, not merely applications.

- **Semantic‑Operational Ontology**  
  Ontology concepts map directly to executable system behaviors.

- **Ledger‑Based Accountability**  
  Immutable, append‑only records ensure verifiable auditability and cross‑system trust.

- **TEE/DID/Audit Chain Binding**  
  Cryptographic identity and execution guarantees tied to secure hardware anchors.

### 1.2 Relationship to the Web and Semantic Web

This project extends Web principles into autonomous agent interaction:

- **Global Interoperability** via URIs, RDF, JSON‑LD  
- **Semantic Clarity** via OWL/RDF definitions  
- **Linked Data + Reasoning** enabling inference over identity, delegation, and execution chains

## 2. Repository Structure

### **2.1 `ontologies/` — Core Semantic Definitions**
- `.ttl` ontology definitions  
- `context/`: JSON‑LD contexts  
- `profiles/`: JSON schema validation profiles  
- `examples/`: Usage samples  

### **2.2 `specs/` — Human‑Readable Specifications**
- Design rationale, conceptual explanations, and narrative specifications  

### **2.3 `discussions/` — Community Collaboration**
- Meeting notes, proposals, community RFCs  

### **2.4 `tests/` — Conformance and Consistency**
- SHACL or equivalent constraint validation suites

## 3. Reference Implementation

The ontology is validated against **SlashLife 的「[AI Workforce OS](https://slashlife.ai/technology/workforceos/)」與「AI Backoffice」**, an agent‑native runtime supporting cross‑border operational use cases.

The CG encourages independent implementations.  
The ontology itself is vendor‑neutral and not bound to any runtime.

## 4. Goals of the Community Group

The CG aims to develop:

- A unified semantic model for agent **identity**, **capabilities**, **delegation**, and **intent**  
- Machine‑interpretable structures enabling **verifiable execution**, **traceability**, and **auditability**  
- Interoperability across multi‑vendor, multi‑jurisdiction, and cross‑layer environments  
- A pathway toward future **W3C Notes** and downstream **ISO/IEC** standardization
