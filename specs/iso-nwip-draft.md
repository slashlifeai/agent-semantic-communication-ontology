# DRAFT - New Work Item Proposal (NWIP)

**ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42**  
**Title:** A Semantic Data Model for Interoperable and Accountable AI Agents

## 1. Title

A Semantic Data Model for Interoperable and Accountable AI Agents

## 2. Scope

This standard specifies a foundational ontology and data model for describing AI agents and their operational environment. The scope includes:

*   A semantic model for **Agent Identity**, including its link to decentralized and federated identity frameworks.
*   A framework for describing Agent **Capabilities** in a machine-interpretable manner.
*   A formal structure for **Delegation of Authority** between agents and between humans and agents, forming verifiable authorization chains.
*   A data model for **Ledger-Based Accountability**, specifying the structure of immutable records for agent actions to ensure traceability and auditability.
*   A model for binding agent identity and execution context to a **Cryptographic Trust Foundation** (e.g., DIDs, TEEs).

This standard is applicable to any system that deploys, manages, or interacts with autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents, particularly in multi-vendor, multi-jurisdiction, and safety-critical environments.

## 3. Purpose and Rationale

The proliferation of AI agents across industries has created a critical need for a common, interoperable framework. Without a standard, the market will fragment into proprietary silos, hindering collaboration, creating security risks, and making regulatory compliance difficult and costly.

This standard addresses this need by providing a robust, open, and machine-readable semantic layer. Its purpose is to:

*   **Enable Interoperability:** Allow AI agents from different developers and organizations to communicate, delegate tasks, and collaborate securely.
*   **Ensure Accountability:** Provide a standardized, auditable trail of agent actions to support governance, risk management, and compliance with regulations such as the EU AI Act.
*   **Enhance Trust:** Establish a verifiable link between an agent's identity, its authorizations, and its actions, rooted in cryptographic principles.
*   **Foster Innovation:** Create a level playing field for innovation, allowing developers to build complex, multi-agent systems by composing services from a global ecosystem.

This work is based on abstractions from a real-world reference implementation (AI Workforce OS), demonstrating its technical feasibility and practical utility in cross-border commercial applications.

## 4. Urgency and Priority

The rapid deployment of AI systems, coupled with the emergence of comprehensive AI regulations (e.g., EU AI Act), creates a significant and urgent need for a standard that addresses accountability and interoperability. Delaying standardization risks market fragmentation and the widespread adoption of non-interoperable, unauditable "black box" agent systems. This project should therefore be considered a high priority.

## 5. Relevant Stakeholders

This standard will be relevant to a wide range of stakeholders, including:
*   AI system developers and providers
*   Cloud platform providers
*   Operating system developers
*   Enterprises in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, logistics)
*   National and international standards bodies
*   Regulatory and government agencies
*   Auditors and compliance professionals
*   Academic and industrial researchers

## 6. Relationship to Other Standards

This work is designed to complement and integrate with existing standards:

*   **ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42:** Serves as a foundational standard for WG1, WG3, and WG6.
*   **W3C DID Core:** Uses Decentralized Identifiers for the core agent identity model.
*   **W3C Verifiable Credentials:** The Delegation model can be implemented using VCs.
*   **eIDAS 2.0 / EUDI ARF:** The Delegation model aligns with the Mandates framework.
*   **IETF:** Leverages various internet standards for communication and security.

## 7. Seed Documents and Initial Contributions

The initial contribution for this work item will be based on the stable specifications from the W3C Semantic Agent Communication Community Group, including:
*   The Semantic Agent Ontology (`.ttl` files)
*   The Core Ontology Specification (`specs/core-ontology.md`)
*   The Explainer and Use Case documents (`specs/Explainer.md`)
*   A reference implementation report.
